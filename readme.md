1. What is the difference between these DOM selectors? getElementById('id') gets one unique element and is the fastest method. getElementsByClassName('class') returns a live list of elements, which updates automatically if you add or remove elements later. querySelector('.class') uses CSS syntax but only retrieves the first matching element it finds. querySelectorAll('.class') uses CSS syntax and collects a static list of all matching elements. This is like taking a snapshot; it won't update automatically. 2. How do you create and insert a new element? It takes three simple steps: Create: Make it with document.createElement('div'). Modify: Add text or classes (for example, myDiv.innerText = "Hello"). Insert: Place it on the page using a parent element (for example, document.body.appendChild(myDiv)). 3. What is Event Bubbling? When you click an element, the event doesn’t stop there. It "bubbles up" to its parent, then to the grandparent, all the way to the top of the document. Example: If you click a <button> inside a <div>, the click event for the button fires first. Then, the click event for the <div> fires automatically. 4. What is Event Delegation? Instead of adding 50 event listeners to 50 different list items (<li>), you attach just one listener to their parent (<ul>). Why it’s useful: It saves memory and improves performance. It also automatically works on new list items you add to the page later. 5. preventDefault() vs stopPropagation()? preventDefault() stops the browser’s default behavior. For example, it prevents a form from refreshing the page or stops a link from opening. stopPropagation() prevents the event from bubbling up. If you click a button inside a card, this stops the card's click event from firing as well.
